Science has a problem. The incentive structures that govern research are misaligned with the pursuit of knowledge. Publication pressure rewards novel positive results over replication. Funding flows to established labs with predictable outputs. Access to research remains gated behind paywalls.

Decentralized Science (DeSci) offers a path forward.

## What's Broken

### The Publication System

Academic publishing extracts value at every step. Researchers give away their work. Peer reviewers donate their time. Universities pay subscription fees to access the results. The system optimizes for publisher profit, not knowledge dissemination.

### Funding Allocation

Grant funding concentrates in safe, incremental work. Revolutionary ideas struggle because they lack track records. Young researchers spend more time writing proposals than doing research. The feedback loop between funding and publication reinforces conservative science.

### Reproducibility Crisis

Studies across fields fail to replicate at alarming rates. Negative results go unpublished. Data and code remain unavailable. Without transparency, science loses its self-correcting nature.

## How Decentralization Helps

### Open Access by Default

Blockchain-native publication means permanent, open access. No paywalls. No platform lock-in. Content-addressed storage ensures availability regardless of any single organization's survival.

### New Funding Mechanisms

Quadratic funding, retroactive grants, and prediction markets create alternative funding paths. These mechanisms can reward high-risk research, support replication studies, and allocate resources based on community assessment rather than committee politics.

### Transparent Incentives

On-chain systems make incentives explicit. Researchers can earn reputation through contributions beyond publication. Peer review becomes compensated and accountable. Data sharing gets rewarded.

### Verifiable Computation

Cryptographic proofs can verify computational results without re-running experiments. Zero-knowledge proofs enable validation while protecting sensitive data. The entire research pipeline becomes auditable.

## DeSci and AI

AI research particularly benefits from decentralization:

1. **Training data provenance**: Cryptographic attestation of data sources
2. **Model verification**: Proofs that published weights match training claims
3. **Distributed compute**: Permissionless contribution to training runs
4. **Governance**: Community control over model behavior and deployment

At Zen, we're building at this intersection. Our AI development follows DeSci principles: open research, transparent processes, community governance.

## The Path Forward

DeSci isn't about replacing traditional science overnight. It's about building parallel infrastructure that demonstrates better alternatives. As these systems prove their value, adoption follows naturally.

We're contributing to this movement through:

- Open publication of all Zen research
- On-chain governance for model development decisions
- Integration with DeSci funding mechanisms
- Tooling for reproducible AI experiments

Science advanced civilization by opening inquiry to all. DeSci extends that opening to the infrastructure of science itself.
