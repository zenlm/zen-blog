All Zen models are built on **Zen MoDE**: Mixture of Distilled Experts. This post explains the architecture, why we chose it, and how distillation and expert routing interact to deliver frontier capability at practical inference cost.

## The Core Problem

There is a fundamental tension in large model design:

- More parameters → better capability
- More parameters → higher inference cost

Dense scaling laws are well established. Doubling parameters roughly halves perplexity (with sufficient data), but doubles inference FLOP. For production deployment, this is often prohibitive.

Sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures break this tradeoff. A model with $N$ total parameters activates only $k$ parameters per token. Capability scales with $N$; inference cost scales with $k$.

The challenge: sparse models are harder to train. Expert collapse (all routing to a small subset) and load imbalance are common failure modes. Distillation from strong dense teachers is our solution.

## Expert Routing

In Zen MoDE, each transformer layer contains $E$ feed-forward expert networks. A lightweight router assigns each token to the top-$k$ experts:

$$\text{route}(x) = \text{TopK}(\text{softmax}(W_r x), k)$$

The final output for a token is the weighted combination of selected expert outputs:

$$\text{FFN}(x) = \sum_{i \in \text{TopK}} g_i \cdot E_i(x)$$

where $g_i$ are the gating scores from the router.

For Zen4 Ultra (480B total, 35B active):
- $E = 128$ experts per layer
- $k = 8$ experts selected per token
- Active parameter fraction: ~7.3%

### Load Balancing

Expert collapse is a training failure mode where a small subset of experts receives nearly all routing weight. We prevent this with a combination of:

1. **Auxiliary load-balancing loss**: Penalizes variance in expert utilization across a batch
2. **Expert-choice routing** in the first two layers: experts select tokens rather than tokens selecting experts
3. **Gradient clipping per-expert**: Prevents any single expert from dominating early training

Our training logs show utilization entropy $> 0.95$ of maximum for all layers by step 10K.

## Distillation

The "Distilled" in MoDE refers to how we initialize and refine experts. Standard MoE training from random initialization is unstable and slow. Our approach:

### Phase 1: Teacher Pre-Training

A dense teacher model is trained to convergence on the full corpus. This teacher encodes rich representations of the training distribution and serves as the knowledge source for distillation.

### Phase 2: Expert Initialization

Experts are initialized by clustering the teacher's FFN weight matrices. We use $k$-means clustering on the weight space to partition the teacher's knowledge into $E$ expert "seeds." This gives each expert a distinct initialization that covers a different region of the input distribution.

### Phase 3: Joint Training with Distillation Loss

The MoE student trains against two objectives simultaneously:

$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{LM}} + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}}$$

The distillation loss minimizes KL divergence between student and teacher output distributions:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{distill}} = \text{KL}(p_{\text{teacher}} \| p_{\text{student}})$$

This keeps experts aligned with the teacher's knowledge while allowing specialization to emerge naturally through routing.

### Phase 4: Expert Specialization

As training progresses, experts naturally specialize. We observe consistent patterns:
- Some experts specialize on code tokens
- Others on mathematical notation
- Others on conversational context
- Some appear to specialize on specific languages

We do not explicitly enforce this specialization — it emerges from the routing gradient.

## Why MoE Beats Dense for Capability/Cost

Consider Zen Max (72B dense equivalent) vs. Zen4 Pro (32B MoE, 22B active). At similar inference cost:

| | Zen Max 72B | Zen4 Pro 32B MoE |
|-|-------------|-----------------|
| Total params | 72B | 32B |
| Active params | 72B | 22B |
| Inference FLOP | 1x | 0.31x |
| MMLU | 87.1 | 85.3 |
| MATH | 73.2 | 71.8 |
| HumanEval | 82.4 | 80.9 |

At 69% lower inference cost, the MoE model is within 2 points on all benchmarks. For most production use cases, this tradeoff is clearly favorable.

## Context Handling

Zen MoDE uses grouped-query attention (GQA) for memory efficiency:

- 8 KV heads shared across 64 query heads
- ~8x reduction in KV cache memory
- Enables longer effective context at the same VRAM budget

For Zen4 Ultra, the native context window is 256K tokens, extending to 1M with YaRN (Yet another RoPE extensioN) scaling.

## Tokenizer

All Zen4 models share a unified tokenizer:
- 151,936 vocabulary size
- Byte-level BPE with UTF-8 pre-tokenization
- Special tokens for chat, tool-use, and reasoning modes
- Code-optimized: reserved token ranges for common code patterns

Compared to smaller vocabularies, this reduces average token count per document by 12% for English and 25% for code.

## Training Infrastructure

Zen models are trained on the Zoo Compute Network:
- Distributed across H100/A100 clusters contributed by network participants
- ZeRO-3 parallelism for memory efficiency
- Pipeline parallelism for very large models
- Gradient checkpointing enabled by default

Training Zen4 Ultra (480B) required 2.1 million GPU-hours. This was funded through the Zoo Labs Foundation treasury (ZIP-72 governance vote) and completed over 6 months.

## Open Weights and Reproducibility

We release all weights, tokenizer configurations, and training hyperparameters. We do not release training data (privacy and licensing constraints), but we publish detailed data composition statistics and filtering methodology.

Architecture configurations are available in the Hugging Face model cards under `hanzoai/`.
