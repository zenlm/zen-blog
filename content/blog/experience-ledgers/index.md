AI agents today suffer from amnesia. Each conversation starts fresh. Each session forgets the last. This isn't just an inconvenience; it's a fundamental limitation on what agents can become.

Today we introduce experience ledgers, a framework for persistent, verifiable agent memory.

## The Memory Problem

Current language models operate in bounded context windows. Information from past interactions must be explicitly retrieved or summarized. This creates several challenges:

1. **Context limits**: Models can only attend to finite token sequences
2. **Retrieval failures**: Important context gets lost or incorrectly recalled
3. **No learning**: Agents don't improve from experience within deployment
4. **Trust gap**: Users can't verify what the agent "remembers"

## Experience Ledgers

An experience ledger is an append-only log of agent experiences with cryptographic attestation. Think of it as a blockchain for agent memory, but optimized for AI workloads.

### Core Properties

**Append-only**: Experiences are added but never modified or deleted. This creates an immutable record of agent history.

**Content-addressed**: Each experience has a unique hash based on its content. References are stable and verifiable.

**Selective disclosure**: Agents can prove they have certain experiences without revealing all memories. Zero-knowledge proofs enable privacy-preserving verification.

**Hierarchical summarization**: Raw experiences are continuously summarized at multiple abstraction levels. Agents can navigate from high-level patterns to specific instances.

### Architecture

```
Raw Experience -> Embedding -> Index -> Summary Layer -> Abstract Layer
       |              |           |            |              |
       v              v           v            v              v
    [Ledger]    [Vector DB]  [Search]   [Compression]   [Reasoning]
```

Each layer serves a different purpose:
- **Raw layer**: Complete transcripts, full fidelity
- **Embedding layer**: Semantic similarity search
- **Index layer**: Structured retrieval by metadata
- **Summary layer**: Compressed representations
- **Abstract layer**: High-level patterns and beliefs

## Implementation

We've built a reference implementation using:

- **Storage**: Content-addressed blocks on IPFS
- **Attestation**: Ed25519 signatures for each entry
- **Indexing**: HNSW vectors with metadata filtering
- **Summarization**: Hierarchical abstractive compression

The system maintains consistency between layers. When raw experiences update, summaries regenerate. When summaries change, abstractions refresh.

## Use Cases

### Personalized Assistants

An agent with an experience ledger remembers user preferences, past conversations, and accumulated context. The user can audit this memory and request modifications.

### Collaborative Research

Multiple agents working on a problem can share experience ledgers. Discoveries propagate. Dead ends are remembered. The collective makes progress.

### Verifiable AI

When an agent claims expertise or references past interactions, the ledger provides proof. Trust becomes verifiable rather than assumed.

## Privacy Considerations

Persistent memory raises legitimate privacy concerns. Our design addresses these through:

- **User control**: Users own their ledger data
- **Selective sync**: Choose what experiences to persist
- **Cryptographic deletion**: Encrypted entries can be made unreadable
- **Audit logs**: All access is recorded

## What's Next

We're releasing the experience ledger specification and reference implementation under Apache 2.0. Initial integration with Zen models comes next quarter.

Memory transforms what agents can do. It's time to give them the ability to remember.
