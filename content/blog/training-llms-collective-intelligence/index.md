Language models are trained on text. That text represents the accumulated knowledge, reasoning, and creativity of countless individuals. Yet the curation process that selects training data receives surprisingly little attention.

## The Data Problem

Most large language models are trained on web scrapes filtered by simple heuristics. This approach has several issues:

1. **Quality variance**: Web content ranges from expert research to spam
2. **Hidden biases**: Filtering decisions embed value judgments
3. **Provenance opacity**: It's unclear what's included or excluded
4. **Legal ambiguity**: Copyright and consent questions remain unresolved

## Our Approach: Transparent Curation

At Zen, we're taking a different path. Our data pipeline operates on three principles.

### Explicit Criteria

Every filtering decision has documented rationale. When we exclude content, we record why. When we weight certain sources higher, we explain the reasoning. This creates an auditable trail.

### Community Input

Data curation involves value judgments. What counts as "quality"? Which perspectives matter? These aren't purely technical questions. We're building mechanisms for community input into curation criteria.

### Provenance Tracking

Each training example links to its source with metadata about:
- Original publication context
- Author information (when available)
- Licensing terms
- Processing steps applied

## Technical Implementation

We've developed a pipeline that processes documents through several stages:

```
Source -> Extraction -> Deduplication -> Quality Scoring -> Attribution -> Storage
```

The quality scoring model itself is trained on human judgments, with explicit criteria:
- Factual accuracy (where verifiable)
- Reasoning coherence
- Writing clarity
- Information density

## Early Results

Our initial corpus contains 2.3 trillion tokens with full provenance tracking. Early experiments suggest that careful curation can match larger but noisier datasets:

| Corpus | Tokens | Benchmark Score |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Web-raw | 5T | 72.3 |
| Web-filtered | 3T | 74.1 |
| Zen-curated | 2.3T | 75.8 |

The numbers are preliminary, but the direction is clear: quality over quantity.

## What This Means

Training on collective intelligence isn't just about scraping more data. It's about respecting the sources, maintaining transparency, and involving the community in decisions that shape AI behavior.

We'll publish our full curation methodology and tooling in the coming months.
