Training large language models requires vast amounts of data. That data often contains sensitive information. Federated learning offers a path to train on distributed, private data without centralizing it.

## The Centralization Problem

Traditional ML training follows a simple pattern: collect data, aggregate it centrally, train models. This creates problems:

- **Privacy risk**: Sensitive data leaves user control
- **Legal barriers**: Regulations prevent data movement across jurisdictions
- **Trust requirements**: Data holders must trust the training party
- **Single points of failure**: Central aggregation creates vulnerabilities

## Federated Learning Basics

Federated learning inverts the pattern. Instead of bringing data to the model, we bring the model to the data.

```
                   +-----------+
                   |  Central  |
                   |  Server   |
                   +-----+-----+
                         |
          +--------------+--------------+
          |              |              |
    +-----v-----+  +-----v-----+  +-----v-----+
    |  Client 1 |  |  Client 2 |  |  Client N |
    |  (Data A) |  |  (Data B) |  |  (Data N) |
    +-----------+  +-----------+  +-----------+
```

1. Central server distributes model weights
2. Clients train locally on their data
3. Clients send gradient updates (not data) back
4. Server aggregates updates into improved model
5. Repeat

Data never leaves client devices. Only model updates travel.

## Challenges at Scale

Federated learning for LLMs faces unique challenges:

### Communication Costs

Model gradients are large. With billions of parameters, naive federation is impractical. We address this through:

- **Gradient compression**: Sparsification and quantization reduce bandwidth by 100-1000x
- **Asynchronous updates**: Clients contribute when convenient, not in synchronized rounds
- **Hierarchical aggregation**: Regional aggregators reduce central server load

### Heterogeneous Compute

Participants have varied hardware. A phone differs from a workstation differs from a server. Our approach:

- **Adaptive batch sizes**: Smaller devices process smaller batches
- **Model sharding**: Large models split across capable participants
- **Contribution weighting**: Update importance scales with compute contributed

### Data Heterogeneity

Different participants have different data distributions. This creates convergence challenges. Solutions:

- **Personalization layers**: Some parameters remain local
- **Clustered federation**: Similar participants form training groups
- **Importance sampling**: Under-represented distributions get higher weight

## Privacy Enhancements

Basic federation protects raw data but gradients can leak information. We add:

### Differential Privacy

Noise added to gradients provides mathematical privacy guarantees. Each participant's contribution becomes statistically indistinguishable.

### Secure Aggregation

Cryptographic protocols ensure the server only sees aggregated updates, not individual contributions. Even a compromised server learns nothing about specific participants.

### Trusted Execution

Hardware enclaves (SGX, TrustZone) provide additional isolation. Computation occurs in protected memory regions.

## Zen Federation Protocol

We've developed a federation protocol specifically for language model training:

1. **Enrollment**: Participants register compute capacity and data characteristics
2. **Matching**: Coordinator assigns participants to training cohorts
3. **Distribution**: Model shards route to appropriate participants
4. **Training**: Local training with privacy-preserving gradient computation
5. **Aggregation**: Secure combination of participant updates
6. **Verification**: Cryptographic proofs of correct computation

Early benchmarks show we achieve 85% of centralized training efficiency while maintaining strong privacy guarantees.

## Join the Network

We're opening the Zen federation network to participants. Contribute compute, contribute data (privately), contribute to open AI.

Requirements:
- Minimum 16GB RAM
- Stable internet connection
- Willingness to run our client software

In return, participants receive:
- Governance tokens proportional to contribution
- Early access to trained models
- Recognition in model cards
