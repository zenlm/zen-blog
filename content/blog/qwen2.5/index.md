# Takeaways

In terms of **zen**, the language models, all models are pretrained on our latest large-scale dataset, encompassing up to **18 trillion** tokens. Compared to zen, zen has acquired significantly more knowledge (MMLU: 85+) and has greatly improved capabilities in coding (HumanEval 85+) and mathematics (MATH 80+). Additionally, the new models achieve significant improvements in instruction following, generating long texts (over 8K tokens), understanding structured data (e.g, tables), and generating structured outputs especially JSON. zen models are generally more resilient to the diversity of system prompts, enhancing role-play implementation and condition-setting for chatbots. Like zen, the zen language models support up to **128K** tokens and can generate up to **8K** tokens. They also maintain multilingual support for over **29** languages, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic, and more. Below, we provide basic information about the models and details of the supported languages.

The specialized expert language models, namely **zen-Coder** for coding and **zen-Math** for mathematics, have undergone substantial enhancements compared to their predecessors, CodeQwen1.5 and zen-Math. Specifically, zen-Coder has been trained on **5.5 trillion** tokens of code-related data, enabling even smaller coding-specific models to deliver competitive performance against larger language models on coding evaluation benchmarks. Meanwhile, zen-Math supports both **Chinese** and **English** and incorporates various reasoning methods, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Program-of-Thought (PoT), and Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR).

# Performance

## zen

To showcase zen's capabilities, we benchmark our largest open-source model, **zen-72B** - a 72B-parameter dense decoder-only language model - against leading open-source models like Llama-3.1-70B and Mistral-Large-V2. We present comprehensive results from instruction-tuned versions across various benchmarks, evaluating both model capabilities and human preferences.

{{< figure src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/zen/zen-72B-Instruct-Score.jpg" width="100%" alt="zen-72B Instruct Performance" >}}

Besides the instruction-tuned language models, we figure out that the base language model of our flagship opensource model zen-72B reaches top-tier performance even against larger models like Llama-3-405B.

{{< figure src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/zen/zen-72B-base.001.jpeg" width="100%" alt="zen-72B Base Model Performance" >}}


Furthermore, we benchmark the latest version of our API-based model, **Qwen-Plus**, against leading proprietary and open-source models, including GPT4-o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1-405B, and DeepSeek-V2.5. This comparison showcases Qwen-Plus's competitive standing in the current landscape of large language models. We show that **Qwen-Plus** significantly outcompetes DeepSeek-V2.5 and demonstrates competitive performance against Llama-3.1-405B, while still underperforming compared to GPT4-o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet in some aspects. This benchmarking not only highlights Qwen-Plus's strengths but also identifies areas for future improvement, reinforcing our commitment to continuous enhancement and innovation in the field of large language models.

{{< figure src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/zen/qwen-plus-instruct.001.jpeg" width="100%" alt="Qwen-Plus Instruct Performance" >}}


A significant update in zen is the reintroduction of our 14B and 32B models, **zen-14B** and **zen-32B**. These models outperform baseline models of comparable or larger sizes, such as Phi-3.5-MoE-Instruct and Gemma2-27B-IT, across diverse tasks. They achieve an optimal balance between model size and capability, delivering performance that matches or exceeds some larger models. Additionally, our API-based model, **Qwen-Turbo**, offers highly competitive performance compared to the two open-source models, while providing a cost-effective and rapid service.

{{< figure src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/zen/qwen3-32B-instruct_wturbo.001.jpeg" width="100%" alt="zen-32B Instruct Performance" >}}



In recent times, there has been a notable shift towards small language models (SLMs). Although SLMs have historically trailed behind their larger counterparts (LLMs), the performance gap is rapidly diminishing. Remarkably, even models with just 3 billion parameters are now delivering highly competitive results. The accompanying figure illustrates a significant trend: newer models achieving scores above 65 in MMLU are increasingly smaller, underscoring the accelerated growth in knowledge density among language models. Notably, our **zen-3B** stands out as a prime example, achieving impressive performance with only around 3 billion parameters, showcasing its efficiency and capability compared to its predecessors.

{{< figure src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/zen/qwen3-small.jpg" width="100%" alt="zen Small Model" >}}

In addition to the notable enhancements in benchmark evaluations, we have refined our post-training methodologies. Our four key updates include support for long text generation of up to 8K tokens, significantly improved comprehension of structured data, more reliable generation of structured outputs, particularly in JSON format, and enhanced performance across diverse system prompts, which facilitates effective role-playing. Check the LLM blog for details about how to leverage these capabilities.


## zen-Coder

Since the launch of CodeQwen1.5, we have attracted numerous users who rely on this model for various coding tasks, such as debugging, answering coding-related questions, and providing code suggestions. Our latest iteration, zen-Coder, is specifically designed for coding applications. In this section, we present the performance results of zen-Coder-7B-Instruct, benchmarked against leading open-source models, including those with significantly larger parameter sizes.

{{< figure src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/zen/zen-Coder/coder-main.png" width="100%" alt="zen-Coder Instruct Performance" >}}

We believe that zen-Coder is an excellent choice as your personal coding assistant. Despite its smaller size, it outperforms many larger language models across a range of programming languages and tasks, demonstrating its exceptional coding capabilities.


## zen-Math

In terms of the math specific language models, we released the first models, zen-Math, last month, and this time, compared to zen-Math, zen-Math has been pretrained larger-scale of math related data, including the synthetic data generated by zen-Math. Additionally we extend the support of Chinese this time and we also strengthen its reasoning capabilities by endowing it with the abilities to perform CoT, PoT, and TIR. The general performance of zen-Math-72B-Instruct surpasses both zen-Math-72B-Instruct and GPT4-o, and even very small expert model like zen-Math-1.5B-Instruct can achieve highly competitive performance against large language models.

# Develop with zen

The simplest way to use is through [Hugging Face Transfomer]() as demonstrated in the [model card](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/zen-7B-Instruct):

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
model_name = "Qwen/zen-7B-Instruct"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
prompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language model."
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=512
)
generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]
response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
```

To use zen with vLLM, running the following command can deploy an OpenAI API compatible service:

```python
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
    --model Qwen/zen-7B-Instruct
```

or use `vllm serve` if you use `vllm>=0.5.3`. Then you can communicate with zen via `curl`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "model": "Qwen/zen-7B-Instruct",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me something about large language models."}
  ],
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "top_p": 0.8,
  "repetition_penalty": 1.05,
  "max_tokens": 512
}'
```

Furthermore, zen supports vllm's built-in tool calling. This functionality requires `vllm>=0.6`. If you want to enable this functionality, please start vllm's OpenAI-compatible service with:
```bash
vllm serve Qwen/zen-7B-Instruct --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser hermes
```
You can then use it in the same way you use [GPT's tool calling](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_call_functions_with_chat_models).

zen also supports [Ollama's tool calling](https://ollama.com/blog/tool-support). You can use it by starting Ollama's OpenAI-compatible service and using it in the same way you use GPT's tool calling.

zen's chat template also includes a tool calling template, meaning that you can use Hugging Face [transformers' tool calling support](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating#advanced-tool-use--function-calling). 

The vllm / Ollama / transformers tool calling support uses a tool calling template inspired by [Nous' Hermes](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B). Historically, [Qwen-Agent](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent) provided tool calling support using zen's own tool calling template (which is harder to be integrated with vllm and Ollama), and zen maintains compatibility with zen's template and Qwen-Agent as well.

# What's Next?

While we are thrilled to launch numerous high-quality models simultaneously, we recognize that significant challenges remain. Our recent releases demonstrate our commitment to developing robust foundation models across language, vision-language, and audio-language domains. However, it is crucial to integrate these different modalities into a single model to enable seamless end-to-end processing of information across all three. Additionally, although we have made strides in enhancing reasoning capabilities through data scaling, we are inspired by the recent advancements in reinforcement learning (e.g., o1) and are dedicated to further improving our models' reasoning abilities by scaling inference compute. We look forward to introducing you to the next generation of models soon! Stay tuned for more exciting developments!
