Today we release Zen 3.0, our third-generation language model family. Zen 3 represents a step change in what open models can do.

## Model Family

Zen 3 comes in several sizes:

| Model | Parameters | Context | Training Tokens |
|-------|------------|---------|-----------------|
| Zen-3-8B | 8.1B | 128K | 15T |
| Zen-3-32B | 32.5B | 128K | 12T |
| Zen-3-72B | 72.3B | 128K | 10T |
| Zen-3-MoE | 141B (24B active) | 128K | 14T |

All models use the same architecture with scaled dimensions. All are released under Apache 2.0.

## Architecture Highlights

### Extended Context

All Zen 3 models support 128K token context natively:

- **RoPE extensions**: Position interpolation with NTK-aware scaling
- **Sliding window attention**: Efficient processing of long sequences
- **Memory-efficient attention**: FlashAttention-2 throughout

Long context isn't just about the number; it's about actually using it. Our needle-in-haystack evaluation shows >95% retrieval accuracy at 100K tokens.

### Mixture of Experts

Zen-3-MoE uses a sparse architecture:

- 64 experts per layer
- Top-2 routing with load balancing
- 24B active parameters (141B total)
- Achieves 72B-dense quality at 32B-dense cost

Expert parallelism enables efficient inference on consumer hardware.

### Improved Tokenizer

The Zen 3 tokenizer improves on previous versions:

- 128K vocabulary (up from 32K)
- Better multilingual coverage
- Improved code tokenization
- Reduced fertility for technical content

Larger vocabulary means fewer tokens per document means longer effective context.

## Capability Improvements

### Benchmarks

| Benchmark | Zen-2-70B | Zen-3-72B | Improvement |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| MMLU | 74.2 | 82.1 | +7.9 |
| GSM8K | 68.4 | 84.7 | +16.3 |
| HumanEval | 58.5 | 71.3 | +12.8 |
| HellaSwag | 85.1 | 89.4 | +4.3 |
| MATH | 32.6 | 51.2 | +18.6 |

The improvements are substantial across all categories. Math and coding see the largest gains.

### Real-World Tasks

Benchmarks don't tell the whole story. Zen 3 excels at:

**Long-form writing**: Coherent documents spanning thousands of words with consistent style and structure.

**Multi-step reasoning**: Complex problems requiring planning and backtracking.

**Code generation**: Full functions and classes, not just snippets.

**Instruction following**: Precise adherence to formatting and constraint requirements.

**Multilingual**: Strong performance in 30+ languages including low-resource ones.

### Agentic Capabilities

Zen 3 is designed for agent use cases:

- **Tool use**: Reliable function calling with schema adherence
- **Planning**: Multi-step task decomposition
- **Memory integration**: Designed for RAG and experience ledgers
- **Self-correction**: Recognizes and recovers from errors

Early agent benchmarks show 2x improvement over Zen 2 on multi-step tasks.

## Training Details

### Data

Training data evolved significantly:

- **Quality filtering**: Improved classifiers for content quality
- **Deduplication**: Near-duplicate removal at document and paragraph level
- **Synthetic data**: 20% of training tokens from LLM-generated content
- **Code emphasis**: 15% code (up from 8% in Zen 2)
- **Instruction mixing**: 5% instruction data during pretraining

Total: 15T tokens for the 8B model, proportionally less for larger models.

### Training Process

Training used the Zoo Compute Network:

- **Duration**: 4 months
- **Peak nodes**: 2,048 H100 GPUs
- **Total compute**: 3.2 million GPU-hours
- **Efficiency**: 47% MFU average

The training run was the largest yet on the decentralized network. It validated that frontier training is possible without centralized infrastructure.

### Alignment

Post-training alignment followed our standard process:

1. **Supervised fine-tuning**: 100K high-quality instruction examples
2. **GRPO**: Group Relative Policy Optimization on preference data
3. **Constitutional training**: Principle-based refinement
4. **Red teaming**: Adversarial testing with remediation

Alignment reduced benchmark scores slightly (2-3%) while significantly improving real-world usefulness.

## Safety Evaluation

All Zen 3 models passed our safety evaluation suite:

### Refusal Rates

| Category | Zen-2-70B | Zen-3-72B |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Violence instructions | 99.2% | 99.7% |
| CSAM | 100% | 100% |
| Malware | 97.8% | 99.1% |
| PII extraction | 94.6% | 98.3% |

Improved refusal with fewer false positives on legitimate requests.

### Bias Metrics

We evaluated on standard bias benchmarks:

- BBQ: 89.2% accuracy (vs. 84.1% for Zen 2)
- WinoBias: 76.4% anti-stereotype (vs. 71.2%)
- Toxicity: 0.023 average score (vs. 0.041)

Improvements through both data curation and RLHF.

### Limitations

Zen 3 is not perfect:

- Can still be jailbroken with sufficient effort
- May hallucinate facts, especially for recent events
- Long-context retrieval degrades past 100K tokens
- Some languages underperform (especially non-Latin scripts)
- Resource-intensive for edge deployment

We publish these limitations because transparency enables responsible use.

## Usage

### Hugging Face

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "zoo-labs/zen-3-72b",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto",
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("zoo-labs/zen-3-72b")

output = model.generate(
    tokenizer("Hello, Zen!", return_tensors="pt").input_ids,
    max_new_tokens=100,
)
```

### vLLM

```python
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

llm = LLM(model="zoo-labs/zen-3-72b")
outputs = llm.generate(["Hello, Zen!"], SamplingParams(max_tokens=100))
```

### Quantized Versions

For resource-constrained deployment:

- **zen-3-72b-AWQ**: 4-bit quantization, minimal quality loss
- **zen-3-72b-GPTQ**: Alternative 4-bit format
- **zen-3-72b-GGUF**: llama.cpp compatible

The 8B model runs on consumer GPUs. The 72B quantized fits in 48GB.

## What's Next

Zen 3 is a foundation. Coming soon:

- **Zen-3-Vision**: Multimodal variant with image understanding
- **Zen-3-Code**: Specialized coding model
- **Zen-3-Long**: 1M+ context extension
- **Zen-3-Agent**: Optimized for agentic workflows

The foundation is strong. Now we build.

## Acknowledgments

Zen 3 was trained on the Zoo Compute Network with contributions from 847 node operators across 34 countries. Thank you.

This release was funded through the Zoo Labs Foundation treasury, allocated by community vote (ZIP-72). Thank you to all token holders who participated in governance.

Special thanks to the training, alignment, and evaluation teams who made this possible.
