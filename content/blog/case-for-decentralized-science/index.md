# Science is Broken

The modern scientific enterprise suffers from systemic dysfunction:

- **Publication cartels** charge researchers to publish and readers to access
- **Reproducibility crisis** undermines trust in published findings
- **Funding concentration** directs resources toward safe, incremental work
- **Credential gatekeeping** excludes capable researchers without institutional affiliation

These are not bugs. They are features of a system optimized for the interests of incumbents, not the advancement of knowledge.

## A Decentralized Alternative

Decentralized Science (DeSci) applies blockchain and cryptographic primitives to scientific infrastructure:

### Open Access by Default

Research outputs---papers, data, code---live on decentralized storage. No paywalls. No permission required. Permanent availability.

### Transparent Peer Review

Reviews are signed, timestamped, and immutable. Reviewers build reputation through quality assessments. Authors can respond publicly. The scientific record includes the full discourse, not just polished final artifacts.

### Permissionless Funding

DAOs allocate research funding through community governance. No grant committees. No political gatekeeping. Researchers propose; token holders vote.

### Verifiable Credentials

On-chain attestations replace institutional affiliations. Your work speaks for itself. Contributions are tracked, verified, and portable.

## DeSci for AI

Artificial intelligence research is particularly suited to decentralized coordination:

1. **Compute can be pooled.** Training runs can be distributed across contributor hardware.

2. **Data can be federated.** Models learn from decentralized datasets without centralizing sensitive information.

3. **Models can be governed.** DAOs can control model releases, usage policies, and development priorities.

4. **Progress can be verified.** Benchmarks and evaluations can be run trustlessly on-chain.

## The Zen Commitment

Zen commits to DeSci principles:

- All research is open access
- Peer review is transparent
- Governance is decentralized
- Contributions are verifiable

We believe these principles are not merely ethical imperatives but practical necessities. Centralized AI development has produced powerful systems with opaque training, unknown biases, and concentrated control. Decentralized development offers an alternative path.

## Join the Movement

DeSci is not a technology. It is a set of principles instantiated through technology. The tools exist: IPFS for storage, Ethereum for coordination, zero-knowledge proofs for privacy.

What remains is the hard work of building institutions that embody these principles. Zen is one such institution. There will be others.

The future of science is open, verifiable, and decentralized. Join us in building it.
