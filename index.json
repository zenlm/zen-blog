We asked a simple question: what happens if we go bigger? The answer surprised us.\nBackground: Why Dimensions Matter Text embeddings map variable-length sequences to fixed-dimensional vectors. These vectors enable semantic similarity search, clustering, and retrieval. The dimension count determines the vector space\u0026rsquo;s capacity.\nLower dimensions mean:\nSmaller storage requirements Faster similarity computations Potential information loss Higher dimensions mean:","title":"7680-Dimensional Embeddings: More Dimensions, Better Retrieval"},{"summary":"The Dimension Question How many dimensions does a text embedding need?\nThe field has settled on conventions: 768 for BERT-scale models, 1536 for OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s ada-002, 4096 for some recent models. But these choices reflect architectural constraints, not fundamental requirements.\nWe investigate what happens when we scale embedding dimensions to 7680\u0026mdash;ten times the BERT baseline.\nWhy Higher Dimensions? Capacity Arguments A $d$-dimensional embedding space can represent $\\mathcal{O}(e^d)$ nearly-orthogonal vectors. For semantic search, we want documents with different meanings to map to different regions.","title":"Embedding Spaces at 7680 Dimensions"},{"summary":"Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become central to aligning language models with human preferences. But current methods like PPO are sample-inefficient and unstable. Today we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a new approach that addresses these limitations.\nThe RLHF Challenge Standard RLHF follows three steps:\nTrain a reward model on human preference data Use the reward model to provide training signal Optimize the policy with reinforcement learning (typically PPO) Step 3 is problematic.","title":"GRPO: Group Relative Policy Optimization"},{"summary":"Beyond PPO Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has become the de facto algorithm for reinforcement learning from human feedback. Yet PPO has fundamental limitations when applied to language models:\nAbsolute reward dependence: PPO optimizes absolute reward values, which are noisy and poorly calibrated KL divergence sensitivity: The KL penalty requires careful tuning to avoid collapse or divergence Sample inefficiency: Each prompt generates one response for learning Reward hacking: Models exploit reward model weaknesses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) addresses these issues through a simple insight: relative comparisons are more informative than absolute scores.","title":"GRPO: Group Relative Policy Optimization"},{"summary":"The Privacy-Utility Tradeoff Federated learning promises to train models on distributed data without centralizing sensitive information. In practice, existing approaches force uncomfortable tradeoffs:\nDifferential privacy adds noise that degrades model quality Secure aggregation increases communication costs Data heterogeneity causes convergence problems Byzantine participants can poison the model We present techniques that mitigate these tradeoffs.\nOur Approach Adaptive Clipping Standard gradient clipping uses a fixed threshold $C$:\n$$g_i^{clipped} = g_i \\cdot \\min\\left(1, \\frac{C}{|g_i|}\\right)$$","title":"Federated Learning Without Compromise"},{"summary":"Training large language models requires vast amounts of data. That data often contains sensitive information. Federated learning offers a path to train on distributed, private data without centralizing it.\nThe Centralization Problem Traditional ML training follows a simple pattern: collect data, aggregate it centrally, train models. This creates problems:\nPrivacy risk: Sensitive data leaves user control Legal barriers: Regulations prevent data movement across jurisdictions Trust requirements: Data holders must trust the training party Single points of failure: Central aggregation creates vulnerabilities Federated Learning Basics Federated learning inverts the pattern.","title":"Federated Learning for Open AI"},{"summary":"AI agents today suffer from amnesia. Each conversation starts fresh. Each session forgets the last. This isn\u0026rsquo;t just an inconvenience; it\u0026rsquo;s a fundamental limitation on what agents can become.\nToday we introduce experience ledgers, a framework for persistent, verifiable agent memory.\nThe Memory Problem Current language models operate in bounded context windows. Information from past interactions must be explicitly retrieved or summarized. This creates several challenges:\nContext limits: Models can only attend to finite token sequences Retrieval failures: Important context gets lost or incorrectly recalled No learning: Agents don\u0026rsquo;t improve from experience within deployment Trust gap: Users can\u0026rsquo;t verify what the agent \u0026ldquo;remembers\u0026rdquo; Experience Ledgers An experience ledger is an append-only log of agent experiences with cryptographic attestation.","title":"Experience Ledgers: Persistent Memory for AI Agents"},{"summary":"Science has a problem. The incentive structures that govern research are misaligned with the pursuit of knowledge. Publication pressure rewards novel positive results over replication.

That text represents the accumulated knowledge, reasoning, and creativity of countless individuals.
