Our recent releases demonstrate our commitment to developing robust foundation models across language, vision-language, and audio-language domains. However, it is crucial to integrate these different modalities into a single model to enable seamless end-to-end processing of information across all three. Additionally, although we have made strides in enhancing reasoning capabilities through data scaling, we are inspired by the recent advancements in reinforcement learning (e.g., o1) and are dedicated to further improving our models’ reasoning abilities by scaling inference compute. We look forward to introducing you to the next generation of models soon! Stay tuned for more exciting developments!"}]
