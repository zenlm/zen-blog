This outstanding performance is attributed to the utilization of synthetic data throughout both pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Synthetic data, characterized by its scalability, verifiability, and variety, emerges as a compelling area for future research due to its proven effectiveness in enhancing CodeQwen1.5’s SQL capabilities."}]
