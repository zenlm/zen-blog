10:T408,Multimodal pretraining has been developing rapidly ever since the transfer of BERT2 to cross-modal representation learning. Representative studies include UNITER3, VilBERT4, etc. These studies directly incorporate the Transformer-based BERT2 to a single-stream or dual stream framework for multimodal pretraining, and transform the image to a sequence of object features to be concatenated with the word embeddings as the input of Transformer. Later in 2021, with the rise of Vision Transformer5, there came methods that got rid of object-level features, which depend on complex preprocessing pipelines, say Faster-RCNN6: For example, the simplest ViLT7 based on patch projection, the CLIP-based8 CLIP-ViL9, etc. One milestone after should be the proposal of SimVLM10, which leverages the T5/BART method for multimodal pretraining and achieves new SoTA in many tasks. These progress should be regarded as the foundation of unified multimodal pretrained models in 2022, including OFA of ours, Unified-IO11, Flamingo12, BeiT-313, etc.6:["$","main",null,{"className":"mx-auto w-full max-w-2xl px-4 py-16","children":[["$","$L5",null,{"href":"/blog","className":"inline-flex items-center gap-1.5 text-sm text-fd-muted-foreground hover:text-fd-foreground mb-10 transition-colors","children":"← Back to Blog"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","time",null,{"className":"text-xs font-mono text-fd-muted-foreground uppercase tracking-wider","children":"November 13, 2022"}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-bold mt-2 mb-3","children":"OFA: Towards Building a One-For-All Model"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-fd-muted-foreground text-lg mb-4","children":"2022 is a year of generalist models!
