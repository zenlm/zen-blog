It then becomes obvious how to synthesize the data once the agent is prepared. For instance, we could enlist volunteers to interact with the agents and record the outcomes to construct the fine-tuning dataset. Additionally, we can employ the agent to cross-validate the data generated by other methods to ensure the quality of the data. Moreover, the general idea of distilling an agent into a model is applicable to other fields as well, such as enhancing a model’s ability to solve long-horizon tasks."}]
