Open AI development has made remarkable progress. It also faces significant challenges. Here’s my honest assessment.\nWhat We’ve Achieved Competitive Models Open models now match or exceed proprietary alternatives in many domains:\nCoding: Open models lead on HumanEval and MBPP Reasoning: Competitive on GSM8K and MATH General knowledge: Within 5% on MMLU Multilingual: Often superior for non-English languages The capability gap that seemed insurmountable in 2021 has largely closed for models under 100B parameters.\nReal Adoption Open models power real applications:\nMillions of API calls daily through community inference providers Thousands of fine-tuned variants for specialized tasks Integration into major development tools Deployment in production systems worldwide This isn’t just research anymore. It’s infrastructure.\nCommunity Scale The open AI community has grown enormously:\nHundreds of contributors to major projects Thousands of researchers building on open foundations Millions of users accessing open models Billions of inference requests monthly Network effects are real. Each contribution makes the ecosystem more valuable.\nPersistent Challenges Compute Concentration Training frontier models requires massive compute. This compute remains concentrated:\nTop 5 cloud providers control 80%+ of AI-grade compute Chip manufacturing bottlenecks persist Training costs continue rising with scale The Zoo Compute Network helps but isn’t yet large enough for frontier training. We need 10x current capacity.\nData Moats Large organizations have accumulated unique datasets:\nProprietary user interactions Licensed content Internal documents Real-world feedback signals Synthetic data and creative commons content help but don’t fully substitute. Data remains a key differentiator.\nCoordination Costs Open development is harder to coordinate than corporate efforts:\nDecisions require consensus Resources are distributed Timelines are uncertain Accountability is diffuse DAOs and governance frameworks help but add overhead. Closed organizations can simply decide and execute.\nSafety Complexity As models become more capable, safety becomes more critical:\nEvaluation is hard (what are we even measuring?) Mitigation often reduces capability Adversarial robustness remains elusive Dual-use concerns complicate openness We can’t ignore safety. We also can’t let it become a barrier to open development.\nThe Path Forward Frontier Open Models Training truly frontier models openly requires:\nScaled compute network: 100K+ GPU network with reliable coordination Novel architectures: Efficiency improvements that reduce compute needs Better data: Synthetic data, simulation, and permissioned partnerships Sustained funding: Multi-year commitments to training runs This is achievable. It requires coordination the community hasn’t yet demonstrated.\nInfrastructure Maturity Open infrastructure needs to mature:\nTraining: Training Gym is solid but needs scaling features Inference: Efficient serving remains fragmented Fine-tuning: Needs better tooling for non-experts Evaluation: Benchmarks don’t capture real-world performance Each layer needs investment. Each layer enables the next.\nGovernance Evolution Current governance works for small decisions. Bigger decisions need:\nFaster processes: Weeks, not months Expert input: Technical decisions need technical judgment Accountability: Approved decisions must be implemented Representation: Diverse stakeholders, not just token holders ZIPs are a start. We need to evolve.\nSafety by Design Open development can lead on safety:\nTransparency: Open models can be audited Diversity: Multiple approaches reduce correlated failures Iteration: Faster feedback loops on safety interventions Community: More eyes on potential problems We should demonstrate that openness enhances safety, not undermines it.\nPredictions for 2025 Concrete predictions to be evaluated:\nOpen models will match GPT-4 class on major benchmarks (\u003e50% confidence) Zoo Compute Network will reach 50K GPUs (60% confidence) At least one open model will be in top-3 on major leaderboards (70% confidence) ZIPs will process \u003e100 proposals (80% confidence) Foundation funding will exceed $50M (40% confidence) I’ll revisit these next November.\nA Personal Note When we started Zen, open AI development was a niche concern. Most assumed the future belonged to well-resourced corporations. That assumption was wrong.\nOpen development has proven viable. Community coordination works. Distributed resources aggregate. Transparency accelerates progress.\nBut viability isn’t victory. The next phase requires:\nSustained commitment through multi-year projects Patience with governance overhead Investment in unsexy infrastructure Honesty about limitations and failures We’ve shown open AI development is possible. Now we need to show it’s preferable.\nThe future of AI is still being written. Let’s write it together.\nZach Kelling is a co-founder of Zoo Labs Foundation.\n","wordCount":"692","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-11-11T09:00:00-08:00","dateModified":"2024-11-11T09:00:00-08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Zach Kelling"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://zenlm.org/blog/future-of-open-ai/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Zen LM","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://zenlm.org/favicon.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>const hasHeaderBg=!1</script><header class=header><div class=nav-container><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=/ accesskey=h title="Zen LM (Alt + H)"><img src=https://zenlm.org/img/logo.png alt aria-label=logo height=30></a></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=/blog/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li><li><a href=/publication title=Publication><span>Publication</span></a></li><li><a href=/about title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://zeekay.blog title=zeekay><span>zeekay</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://hanzo.blog title=hanzo.blog><span>hanzo.blog</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://hanzo.ai/chat title="Try Zen Chat"><span>Try Zen Chat</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://blog.zoo.ngo title="zoo blog"><span>zoo blog</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></div></header><div class=hero-container><div class=hero><h1 class=post-title>The Future of Open AI</h1><div class=post-description>Reflections on where open AI development is heading and what it will take to get there.</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-11-11 09:00:00 -0800 -0800'>November 11, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;692 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Zach Kelling</div></div></div><main class=main><article class=post-single><div class=post-content><p>Four years into Zen&rsquo;s development, it&rsquo;s worth stepping back to assess where we are and where we&rsquo;re going.
