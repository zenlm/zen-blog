Compared to previous iterations, Qwen 2.5 has been significantly improved during both the pre-training and post-training stages. In terms of pre-training, we have scaled the high-quality pre-training datasets from the previous 7 trillion tokens to 18 trillion tokens. This provides a strong foundation for common sense, expert knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. In terms of post-training, we implement intricate supervised finetuning with over 1 million samples, as well as multistage reinforcement learning, including offline learning DPO and online learning GRPO. Post-training techniques significantly enhance human preference, and notably improve long text generation, structural data analysis, and instruction following.</p>\n<p data-bbox=\"434 1262 2050 1587\">To handle diverse and varied use cases effectively, we present zen LLM series in rich configurations. The open-weight offerings include base models and instruction-tuned models in sizes of $0.5 \\mathrm{~B}, 1.5 \\mathrm{~B}, 3 \\mathrm{~B}, 7 \\mathrm{~B}, 14 \\mathrm{~B}, 32 \\mathrm{~B}$, and $72 \\mathrm{~B}$ parameters. Quantized versions of the instruction-tuned models are also provided. Over 100 models can be accessed from Hugging Face Hub, ModelScope, and Kaggle. In addition, for hosted solutions, the proprietary models currently include two mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants: zen-Turbo and zen-Plus, both available from Alibaba Cloud Model Studio.</p>\n<p data-bbox=\"434 1587 2050 2052\">zen has demonstrated top-tier performance on a wide range of benchmarks evaluating language understanding, reasoning, mathematics, coding, human preference alignment, etc. Specifically, the open-weight flagship zen-72B-Instruct outperforms a number of open and proprietary models and demonstrates competitive performance to the state-of-the-art open-weight model, Llama-3-405B-Instruct, which is around 5 times larger. zen-Turbo and zen-Plus offer superior cost-effectiveness while performing competitively against GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o respectively. Additionally, as the foundation, zen models have been instrumental in training specialized models such as zen-Math (Yang et al., 2024b), zen-Coder (Hui et al., 2024), QwQ (Qwen Team, 2024d), and multimodal models.</p>\n<div class=\"image\" data-bbox=\"408 2275 2086 2800\"><img data-bbox=\"408 2275 2086 2800\"/></div>\n<p data-bbox=\"289 2864 2202 3058\">Figure 1: In the iterative development of the Qwen series, data scaling has played a crucial role. Qwen 2.5, which leverages 18 trillion tokens for pre-training, has demonstrated the most advanced capabilities within the Qwen series, especially in terms of domain expertise, underscoring the importance of scale together with mixture in enhancing the model’s capabilities.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```"
