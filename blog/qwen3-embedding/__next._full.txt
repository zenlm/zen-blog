23:T561,The training framework for the Qwen3 Embedding series follows the multi-stage training paradigm established by the GTE-Qwen series. During the training of the Embedding model, we implemented a three-stage training structure: the first stage involves contrastive pre-training with a large volume of weakly supervised data; the second stage focuses on supervised training using high-quality labeled data; and the final stage integrates multiple candidate models through a merging strategy to enhance overall performance. This staged training mechanism effectively balances the model’s generalization ability and task adaptability. For the Reranking model, based on empirical validation results, we directly employed high-quality labeled data for supervised training, significantly improving training efficiency. Notably, during the first stage of weakly supervised training for the Embedding model, we developed an innovative multi-task adaptable prompt system. By leveraging the text generation capabilities of the Qwen3 foundation model, we dynamically generated weakly supervised text pairs tailored to different task types and languages. This approach addressed the limitations of traditional methods, which often relied on community forums or open-source data for text relevance pair collection, facilitating the efficient generation of large-scale weakly supervised data.20:["$","p",null,{"children":"$23"}]
