10:T434,What does it mean to think, to question, to understand? These are the deep waters that QwQ (Qwen with Questions) wades into. Like an eternal student of wisdom, it approaches every problem - be it mathematics, code, or knowledge of our world - with genuine wonder and doubt. QwQ embodies that ancient philosophical spirit: it knows that it knows nothing, and that’s precisely what drives its curiosity. Before settling on any answer, it turns inward, questioning its own assumptions, exploring different paths of thought, always seeking deeper truth. Yet, like all seekers of wisdom, QwQ has its limitations. This version is but an early step on a longer journey - a student still learning to walk the path of reasoning. Its thoughts sometimes wander, its answers aren’t always complete, and its wisdom is still growing. But isn’t that the beauty of true learning? To be both capable and humble, knowledgeable yet always questioning? We invite you to explore alongside QwQ, embracing both its insights and its imperfections as part of the endless quest for understanding.6:["$","main",null,{"className":"mx-auto w-full max-w-2xl px-4 py-16","children":[["$","$L5",null,{"href":"/blog","className":"inline-flex items-center gap-1.5 text-sm text-fd-muted-foreground hover:text-fd-foreground mb-10 transition-colors","children":"← Back to Blog"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","time",null,{"className":"text-xs font-mono text-fd-muted-foreground uppercase tracking-wider","children":"November 27, 2024"}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-bold mt-2 mb-3","children":"QwQ: Reflect Deeply on the Boundaries of the Unknown"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-fd-muted-foreground text-lg mb-4","children":"GITHUB HUGGING FACE MODELSCOPE DEMO DISCORD"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-3 pt-4 border-t border-fd-border","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"text-sm text-fd-muted-foreground","children":["By ","Zen LM Team"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex gap-1.5 ml-auto","children":[]}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none","children":[["$","p",null,{"children":[["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"https://github.com/QwenLM/zen","children":"GITHUB"}]," ",["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"https://huggingface.co/Qwen","children":"HUGGING FACE"}]," ",["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"https://modelscope.cn/organization/qwen","children":"MODELSCOPE"}]," ",["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"https://huggingface.co/spaces/Qwen/QwQ-32B-preview","children":"DEMO"}]," ",["$","$Lf",null,{"href":"https://discord.gg/yPEP2vHTu4","children":"DISCORD"}]]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["$","em",null,{"children":"Note: This is the pronunciation of QwQ: /kwju:/ , similar to the word “quill”."}]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"$10"}],"\n",["$","h1",null,{"className":"flex scroll-m-28 flex-row items-center gap-2","id":"limitations","children":[["$","a",null,{"data-card":"","href":"#limitations","className":"peer","children":"Limitations"}],["$","svg",null,{"ref":"$undefined","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","width":24,"height":24,"viewBox":"0 0 24 24","fill":"none","stroke":"currentColor","strokeWidth":2,"strokeLinecap":"round","strokeLinejoin":"round","className":"lucide lucide-link size-3.5 shrink-0 text-fd-muted-foreground opacity-0 transition-opacity peer-hover:opacity-100","aria-hidden":true,"children":[["$","path","1cjeqo",{"d":"M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"}],["$","path","19qd67",{"d":"M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"}],"$undefined"]}]]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":[["$","strong",null,{"children":"QwQ-32B-Preview"}]," is an experimental research model developed by the Qwen Team, focused on advancing AI reasoning capabilities.
