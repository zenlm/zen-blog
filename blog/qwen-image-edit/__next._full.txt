Qwen-Image-Edit’s powerful semantic editing capability enables effortless and diverse creation of original IP content. Furthermore, on Qwen Chat, we designed a series of editing prompts centered around the 16 MBTI personality types. Leveraging these prompts, we successfully created a set of MBTI-themed emoji packs based on our mascot Capybara, effortlessly expanding the IP’s reach and expression."}]
19:T5ef,Moreover, novel view synthesis is another key application scenario in semantic editing. As shown in the two example images below, Qwen-Image-Edit can not only rotate objects by 90 degrees, but also perform a full 180-degree rotation, allowing us to directly see the back side of the object:Another typical application of semantic editing is style transfer. For instance, given an input portrait, Qwen-Image-Edit can easily transform it into various artistic styles such as Studio Ghibli. This capability holds significant value in applications like virtual avatar creation:In addition to semantic editing, appearance editing is another common image editing requirement. Appearance editing emphasizes keeping certain regions of the image completely unchanged while adding, removing, or modifying specific elements. The image below illustrates a case where a signboard is added to the scene. As shown, Qwen-Image-Edit not only successfully inserts the signboard but also generates a corresponding reflection, demonstrating exceptional attention to detail.Below is another interesting example, demonstrating how to remove fine hair strands and other small objects from an image.Additionally, the color of a specific letter “n” in the image can be modified to blue, enabling precise editing of particular elements.Appearance editing also has wide-ranging applications in scenarios such as adjusting a person’s background or changing clothing. The three images below demonstrate these practical use cases respectively.14:["$","p",null,{"children":"$19"}]
15:["$","p",null,{"children":"Another standout feature of Qwen-Image-Edit is its accurate text editing capability, which stems from Qwen-Image’s deep expertise in text rendering. As shown below, the following two cases vividly demonstrate Qwen-Image-Edit’s powerful performance in editing English text:Qwen-Image-Edit can also directly edit Chinese posters, enabling not only modifications to large headline text but also precise adjustments to even small and intricate text elements."}]
16:["$","p",null,{"children":"Finally, let’s walk through a concrete image editing example to demonstrate how to use a chained editing approach to progressively correct errors in a calligraphy artwork generated by Qwen-Image:In this artwork, several Chinese characters contain generation errors. We can leverage Qwen-Image-Edit to correct them step by step. For instance, we can draw bounding boxes on the original image to mark the regions that need correction, instructing Qwen-Image-Edit to fix these specific areas. Here, we want the character “稽” to be correctly written within the red box, and the character “亭” to be accurately rendered in the blue region.However, in practice, the character “稽” is relatively obscure, and the model fails to correct it correctly in one step. The lower-right component of “稽” should be “旨” rather than “日”. At this point, we can further highlight the “日” portion with a red box, instructing Qwen-Image-Edit to fine-tune this detail and replace it with “旨”."}]
